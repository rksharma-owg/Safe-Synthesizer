## Enabling Debug Logging

Most troubleshooting steps below recommend running with debug logging.
Use the `-v` flag for debug output, or `-vv` to also include dependency
logs (vLLM, HuggingFace, etc.):

```bash
safe-synthesizer run -v --config config.yaml --url data.csv
```

Debug logging adds:

- Generation diagnostics: EOS token configuration, per-prompt finish
  reasons and token counts, vLLM progress bars
- Training details: data assembly statistics, example counts
- SamplingParams: the full vLLM parameter object used for generation

You can also set the log level via environment variable:

```bash
export NSS_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

See [Running -- Logging](running.md#logging-and-experiment-tracking) for the full logging
configuration reference.

## Installation

### Transformers v5 + vLLM Version Selection

`uv sync` fails with an error mentioning incompatible `transformers` and
`vllm` requirements.

Safe Synthesizer requires `transformers>=5.12,<5.12.1` with vLLM 0.26.0.
Keep vLLM's constraints intact so the resolver selects the tested
Transformers/vLLM pairing.

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
  "transformers>=5.12,<5.12.1",
  "vllm==0.26.0",
]
```

If you've vendored or copied parts of `pyproject.toml` into another project,
avoid adding a broad `transformers>=5.0,<6` override for vLLM. That can erase
vLLM's explicit constraints and allow incompatible Transformers releases.

### Slow Tokenizer Warning

After upgrading to transformers v5 you may see a log line like:

> Loaded slow (Python) tokenizer for `<model>` — no Rust backend available.

This means the model's tokenizer has no Rust (`tokenizers` crate)
implementation and v5 fell back to the SentencePiece/Python backend. Data
prep continues to work but tokenization is ~5–10× slower than the fast
path. Common causes:

- Local cached tokenizer is missing `tokenizer.json` — re-download
  with `huggingface-cli download <model>`
- Model ships only a SentencePiece vocab (`tokenizer.model`) with no Rust
  `tokenizer.json` — common on older checkpoints; fast conversion may land upstream.
- `trust_remote_code=True` model with a custom slow tokenizer class.

The warning is informational. To suppress it, switch to a model with a
fast tokenizer (most popular models do; check
`AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model).is_fast`).

### Unsupported Python Versions

Safe Synthesizer supports Python 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14. Python 3.15+ is
not supported. Attempting to install on an unsupported interpreter fails during
`pip install` or `uv pip install`.

To fix, create a virtual environment with a supported interpreter:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.13
source .venv/bin/activate
```

The project's `pyproject.toml` enforces `requires-python = ">=3.11, <3.15"`, so
package managers will reject the install on unsupported versions.

## Training

GPU memory, context length, and backend issues during fine-tuning.

### Out of Memory During Training

Training OOM errors appear during the "Training" phase with HuggingFace Trainer
stack traces. If you see `torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError`:

1. Enable 4-bit quantization -- the single largest memory saver. Set
   `training.quantize_model: true` and `training.quantization_scheme: bnb-4bit`
   (or for back-compat, `training.quantization_bits: 4`). QLoRA stores the
   frozen base model in 4-bit NF4 while training LoRA adapters in full
   precision, cutting model weight memory by ~4x. Quantization reduces
   precision in the frozen weights; in practice QLoRA typically produces
   results close to full-precision LoRA, but verify with your evaluation
   report. On Blackwell hardware, `nvfp4` and `mxfp4` schemes offer similar
   4-bit footprint with hardware-accelerated matmul — see
   [Quantization schemes](configuration.md#quantization-schemes)
2. Reduce the context window -- see
   [Context Length and Record Fitting](#context-length-and-record-fitting) for
   how to lower `training.rope_scaling_factor`, truncate records, or simplify
   grouped examples. Longer sequences require more activation memory even with
   gradient checkpointing enabled
3. Verify `training.batch_size` is `1` (the default). The effective batch
   size is `batch_size * gradient_accumulation_steps` (default 1 x 8 = 8).
   Peak memory is set by the forward/backward pass on one micro-batch --
   `gradient_accumulation_steps` controls how many micro-batches accumulate
   before each optimizer step but does not affect peak memory
4. Lower `training.max_vram_fraction` (default `0.8`) to leave headroom for
   other GPU consumers on the same device

GPU memory during LoRA SFT breaks down into three components:

- Base model weights (dominant) -- ~14 GiB for a 7B model in fp16, ~3.5 GiB
  in 4-bit. Quantization targets this component
- Activations (proportional to sequence length and batch size) --
  self-attention computes an n x n score matrix, so activation memory scales
  [quadratically with sequence length](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_memory_anatomy).
  Gradient checkpointing, which Safe Synthesizer enables by default, reduces
  this by recomputing activations during the backward pass instead of storing
  them. Context length and batch size target this component
- LoRA adapter gradients and optimizer states (small) -- typically < 1 GiB
  for standard LoRA ranks

For deeper coverage, see
[Methods and tools for efficient training on a single GPU](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/perf_train_gpu_one)
in the HuggingFace documentation.

### No GPU Detected

If training fails to find a GPU, the HuggingFace backend will attempt to use
CPU (extremely slow and not recommended for production training).

To diagnose:

1. Verify NVIDIA drivers: `nvidia-smi`
2. Verify PyTorch CUDA build: `python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"`
3. Ensure you installed the CUDA extras, not the CPU-only package.
   See [Installation](getting-started.md#install-the-package) for the
   full command with required index URLs.

### Context Length and Record Fitting

The effective context window (`max_seq_length`) is a computed property on
[`ModelMetadata`][nemo_safe_synthesizer.llm.metadata.ModelMetadata] --
`base_max_seq_length * rope_scaling_factor`. Every training example must
fit within this window. If it doesn't, data assembly fails with a
`GenerationError` before training even starts.

#### When Records Don't Fit

Two error messages indicate context-length problems during data assembly:

```text
The number of tokens in an example exceeds the available context length
```

A single training example (schema prompt + records) exceeds
`max_seq_length`.

```text
The dataset schema requires more tokens than the max length of the model
```

The schema prompt alone is wider than `max_seq_length` -- typically
because the table has too many columns for the model's context window.

#### How to Fix

1. Reduce record size -- shorten text fields, drop unnecessary columns,
   or simplify the schema.
2. When using `data.group_training_examples_by`, all records in the same group must fit
   in context together, making the limit tighter. Consider reducing the number of records per group.

    ??? tip "Sizing formula (approximate)"
        Estimate token budget before adjusting parameters. The /4 divisor is
        a rough heuristic for BPE tokenizers on JSON content (actual ratios
        vary by tokenizer and content):

        - `tokens_per_group ≈ (records_per_group × chars_per_record) / 4`
        - `total ≈ prompt_tokens + tokens_per_group × max_sequences_per_example`

        Example: 5 records × 200 chars ≈ 250 tokens/group; with a 400-token
        prompt and 3 groups per example: `400 + 250 × 3 = 1150` tokens.

        See [Example Generation -- Sizing](../developer-guide/example-generation.md#sizing-and-context-budget)
        for per-mode formulas.

3. If using `TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0`, increase `training.rope_scaling_factor` to
   extend the context window.
   When set to `"auto"`, it is estimated from dataset token counts using
   heuristics (4 chars per token for text, 1 token per digit) -- this can
   underestimate for complex or multilingual data. `training.rope_scaling_factor` is not applicable when using `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM3-3B` (default model) or `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3`.

!!! note "Error type clarification"
    These errors are typed as `GenerationError` in the codebase even though
    they fire during data assembly, not during generation proper. They appear
    in the pipeline before any training or generation occurs.

Context-length issues can also surface as OOM during training (the model
attempts to process sequences near the limit). See
[Out of Memory During Training](#out-of-memory-during-training) for
memory-specific fixes like quantization and batch size reduction.

### Grouped Data Produces Very Few Training Examples

When using `data.group_training_examples_by`, the assembler packs multiple
groups into each training example to fill the context window. With
large-context models (e.g. SmolLM3 at 12288 tokens) and small records,
a 200-record dataset with 12 groups can compress into as few as 2 training
examples. Combined with `gradient_accumulation_steps=8` (default), this
yields only 1 gradient step -- effectively no training.

The training log confirms this pattern:

```text
Num examples = 2 | Num Epochs = 1 | Total steps = 1
```

Training duration is controlled by `training.num_input_records_to_sample`,
not epochs. The internal `data_fraction` is computed as
`num_input_records_to_sample / total_training_records`. Values above 1.0
duplicate and reshuffle the training examples. To get meaningful training
with grouped data:

- Decrease `max_sequences_per_example` -- this is the preferred first
  step. Fewer groups per example means the assembler produces more
  training examples, which means more gradient steps per epoch -- without
  increasing training time per step. Start with
  `max_sequences_per_example: 1` and increase only if quality suffers.
  (Sequential/time-series mode already enforces one group per example,
  so this knob only applies to grouped mode.)
- If reducing groups per example is not enough, increase
  `num_input_records_to_sample`. Set it to `N * dataset_size` for
  approximately N passes over the data.
- Watch for `Total steps = 1` in the Trainer output -- this means the model
  barely trained

---

## Generation

VRAM, invalid records, and early stopping during synthetic data production.

### Out of Memory During Generation

Generation OOM errors appear during the "Generation" phase with vLLM.
GPU allocation defaults to 80% of available VRAM. Training exposes
`training.max_vram_fraction` to override this; generation does not yet have
an equivalent config field.

1. Ensure no other processes hold GPU memory -- training cleanup should release
   it, but verify with `nvidia-smi`
2. If the GPU has less memory than expected, check that the training teardown
   completed before generation started

### Slow Generation with Large-Context Models

Generation may appear to hang with large-context models (SmolLM3, Llama 3,
etc.) when using `data.group_training_examples_by`. Two factors combine
to cause long generation times:

`max_tokens` scales with context window: each generation prompt is allowed
up to `max_seq_length` output tokens (`12,288` for SmolLM3). If the model
produces long outputs before the stop condition fires, each prompt in the
batch takes proportionally longer. Every 60 seconds a heartbeat line is
logged starting with `Generation in progress`, plus a short note that new
records only appear after a full batch of prompts finishes. Long
stretches with no new records are normal while generation is still running.

Long-tail batch latency: vLLM processes all prompts in a batch
simultaneously, but `llm.generate()` blocks until every prompt completes.
With `temperature=0.9` (default), each prompt samples a different
generation path. Most paths produce compact output and hit the EOS token
quickly, but a few diverge into longer text before the model emits EOS.
This variance is worse with undertrained models -- instead of reliably
producing `<|im_start|> records... <|im_end|>`, the model sometimes
wanders into chat-style explanations of unpredictable length.

E.g., in one
observed run with SmolLM3-3B, 96 of 100 prompts finished in 67 seconds,
while the last 4 took an additional 93 seconds -- with a single prompt
consuming 61 seconds and 1618 tokens on its own. The batch cannot return
until the slowest prompt finishes. Run with `-v` to see vLLM's tqdm
progress bar, which shows per-prompt completion rates and makes the tail
effect visible.

If this stage takes more than 10 minutes, you might need to train the model
more or examine the training parameters.

To diagnose, check the batch summary logs first. When vLLM reports why
outputs stopped, the `Batch Generation Summary` includes aggregate
`finish_reasons` counts. Run with `-v` (debug logging) for per-prompt
details:

- Sampling parameters, including EOS token configuration, `max_tokens`,
  and stop conditions
- Per-prompt output: token count, `finish_reason`, and `stop_reason`

If outputs show `finish_reason=stop`, the stop condition is working and
the generation time is real inference time. If outputs show
`finish_reason=length`, they ran to `max_tokens` without producing an EOS
token or a complete parseable record -- this can indicate insufficient
training or an overly tight output-token budget (see
[Grouped Data Produces Very Few Training Examples](#grouped-data-produces-very-few-training-examples)).

### GenerationError

Generation failures during synthetic data production. The two most common:

```text
Generation stopped prematurely due to no valid records
```

: The first batch produced zero valid records. The model may be underfitting
  or the schema may not match the training data. Increase
  `training.num_input_records_to_sample` to give the model more context,
  and check training logs for quality issues. If the batch summary shows
  `finish_reasons` dominated by `length`, generation reached `max_tokens`
  before producing valid records; inspect prompt size, schema size, and
  grouped/time-series prefill length before treating it as model quality
  alone.

```text
Generation stopped prematurely because the average fraction of invalid records was higher than...
```

: Too many invalid records across `generation.patience` consecutive batches.
  Consider retraining with more records, adjusting `training.num_input_records_to_sample`, or setting `generation.structured_generation.enabled=true`.

For context-length errors during data assembly (`"The number of tokens in an
example exceeds the available context length"`), see
[Context Length and Record Fitting](#context-length-and-record-fitting).

## Evaluation

Memory and scope issues during quality scoring and report generation.

### Out of Memory During Evaluation

If evaluation OOMs, reduce the evaluation scope or dataset size:

1. For wide datasets, PCA computation in deep structure analysis can OOM.
   Reduce the number of columns included in evaluation by lowering
   `evaluation.sqs_report_columns` or by subsetting the input data. If
   evaluation is not required for your run, disable it entirely with
   `evaluation.enabled: false`.
2. Histogram binning uses the `doane` method to reduce memory, but very large
   datasets may still cause issues. Reduce `evaluation.sqs_report_columns` or
   `evaluation.sqs_report_rows` to limit the evaluation scope.

!!! tip "Evaluation and Data Quality"
    SQS scores, UNAVAILABLE metrics, report limits, and low-quality
    diagnostics are covered in [Synthetic Data Quality](evaluating-data.md#evaluation).

---

## Configuration

Defaults, auto-resolution, and validation errors for pipeline parameters.

### Surprising Defaults

Several defaults may not match your expectations:

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| `training.batch_size` | `1` | Effective batch = `batch_size` x `gradient_accumulation_steps` (8) |
| `training.validation_ratio` | `0.0` | No validation split by default |
| `data.holdout` | `0.05` | 5% of records held out for evaluation; capped by `data.max_holdout` (2000) |
| `data.random_state` | `None` | Auto-generates a random seed -- set this value explicitly if you need reproducibility |
| `generation.num_records` | `1000` | May be too small for production use |

### Auto-Resolved Parameters

Many parameters accept `"auto"` and are resolved at runtime by the
[`AutoConfigResolver`][nemo_safe_synthesizer.config.autoconfig.AutoConfigResolver].
See [Configuration Reference](configuration.md) for the full list.

- `training.rope_scaling_factor` -- auto-estimated from dataset token counts;
  see [Context Length and Record Fitting](#context-length-and-record-fitting)
  for details and caveats
- `training.num_input_records_to_sample` -- derived from `rope_scaling_factor * 25000`
- `training.learning_rate` -- model-specific default from `ModelMetadata`:
  Mistral uses 0.0001, all other supported model families use 0.0005
- `data.max_sequences_per_example` -- resolves to `1` when differential
  privacy is enabled (required to limit per-example gradient contribution),
  `10` otherwise for best performance
- `privacy.delta` -- computed from record count

Use `safe-synthesizer config validate` to see how `"auto"` and default values resolve for
your configuration. Note that some `"auto"` fields (such as
`training.rope_scaling_factor` and `training.num_input_records_to_sample`)
require a dataset to resolve -- they will remain `"auto"` in the validate
output and only resolve during an actual run:

```bash
safe-synthesizer config validate --config config.yaml
```

### Common Validation Errors

`order_training_examples_by` requires `group_training_examples_by`:

: If you set `data.order_training_examples_by` without also setting
  `data.group_training_examples_by`, config validation will fail. Ordering only
  makes sense within groups.

`group_training_examples_by` with comma-separated column names:

: Setting `data.group_training_examples_by: col1,col2` in YAML is parsed as the
  single string `"col1,col2"`, not as two separate columns. The pipeline will
  fail with a `ParameterError` when it tries to find a column literally named
  `"col1,col2"` in your data:

    ```text
    ParameterError: Group by column 'patient_id,event_id' not found in the input data.
    The column name contains a comma -- multi-column grouping is not supported.
    Use a single column name.
    ```

  Only a single column name is supported. Multi-column grouping is not
  currently available. If you need to group by multiple columns, consider
  creating a composite column in your data before running the pipeline
  (e.g. concatenate `patient_id` and `event_id` into a new
  `patient_event_id` column).

Unsupported file extensions:

: The `url` parameter accepts `.csv`, `.json`, `.jsonl`, `.parquet`, and `.txt`
  files. Other formats raise a `ValueError`.

Incompatible DP settings:

: If `privacy.dp_enabled` is `true` but `data.max_sequences_per_example` is
  not `1`, config validation will fail with a clear error message. Set it to
  `"auto"` and it will resolve correctly.

!!! tip "Differential Privacy"
    DP errors and privacy budget troubleshooting are covered in
    [Synthetic Data Quality](evaluating-data.md#differential-privacy).

## Pre-flight Validation Codes

When running with `--validate` (CLI) or `process_data(check_only=True)` (SDK),
the following codes may appear. For an overview of what pre-flight validates,
how to interpret the output, and how to use the resolved config, see
[Running -- `run --validate`](running.md#run-validate).

The `Check` column lists the check name (as emitted in the report and
accepted by `disabled_checks`). `preflight.check_crash` is synthesized
by the orchestrator and appears attached to the name of whichever check
raised; treat it as metadata on that check rather than a separate
check of its own.

| Code | Severity | Check | Description |
|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `torch_missing` | error | `gpu.cuda` | PyTorch not installed; cannot verify GPU availability |
| `no_gpu` | error | `gpu.cuda` | No CUDA GPU detected (required for training or generation) |

| `hf_model_cache_incomplete` | warning/error | `env.hf_model_availability` | Cached Hugging Face model snapshot is missing required config, tokenizer, weights, or shards; severity is error when HF offline mode is enabled |
| `hf_remote_code_not_cached` | warning/error | `env.hf_model_availability` | Trusted model references remote code that is not cached locally; severity is error when HF offline mode is enabled |
| `preflight.check_crash` | error | (crashing check) | A check raised an unexpected exception; the issue's `check` field names the crashing check and other checks continued running |
| `column_not_found` | error | `columns.groupby` / `columns.orderby` | Required column missing from dataset, or input DataFrame uses unsupported MultiIndex columns |

## PII Replacement

PII replacement v3 troubleshooting guidance will be added in a later update.

---

## WandB

### Authentication Failures

WandB requires an API key when running in `online` mode. If the key is missing
or invalid, training will fail when the WandB run is initialized.

```text
wandb: ERROR api_key not configured (no-auth)
```

Set the API key before running:

```bash
export WANDB_API_KEY="your-api-key"  # pragma: allowlist secret
```

Or switch to offline mode to avoid network access entirely:

```bash
safe-synthesizer run --wandb-mode disabled --config config.yaml --data-source data.csv
```

See [Running Safe Synthesizer -- WandB Integration](running.md#wandb-integration) for the full WandB setup.

### Resume Errors

If a WandB run fails to resume (e.g., the run ID no longer exists on the WandB server),
pass `--wandb-resume-job-id` with a valid run ID from the same WandB project, or
remove the argument to start a fresh WandB run.

---

## Time Series

!!! warning "Experimental"
    Time series synthesis is an experimental feature. APIs and behavior may
    change between releases.

Time series synthesis has additional validation and generation requirements.
For configuration examples, see [Configuration -- Time Series](configuration.md#time-series).

### Common Issues

Missing timestamp values:

: Any `NaN` or `null` values in the timestamp column raise a `DataError`.
  Clean your data before running the pipeline:

    ```python
    df = df.dropna(subset=["timestamp"])
    df = df.sort_values(by=["group_column", "timestamp"])
    ```

Interval mismatch:

: If `timestamp_interval_seconds` does not match the actual intervals in your
  data, pre-flight and training fail with `timestamp_interval_mismatch`.
  Verify your interval setting matches the data and is a positive whole number
  of seconds. Fractional/sub-second intervals are not supported; resample or
  represent the data at whole-second resolution. Time-series synthesis is
  experimental, and this validation is intentionally strict so mismatches are
  caught before expensive pipeline stages.

Groups skipped during generation:

: If a group consistently produces invalid records (exceeding
  `generation.patience` consecutive batches above
  `generation.invalid_fraction_threshold`), that group is skipped entirely.
  Check your training data quality for those groups.

Out-of-order records:

: During generation, records are validated for chronological order. Records
  that arrive out of order are marked invalid.

#### Groups must have same start

All groups in the dataset must begin at the same timestamp when
`time_series.start_timestamp` is `null` (inferred from data). If group
start timestamps differ, the pipeline raises a `DataError`. Either align
all group start timestamps in your data, or set
`time_series.start_timestamp` to an explicit value that applies to all
groups.

## Error Classes

Safe Synthesizer uses a structured error hierarchy. Understanding which error
class you received helps narrow down the cause and write targeted `except` clauses.

Inheritance:

```text
SafeSynthesizerError
├── InternalError (also RuntimeError)
└── UserError
    ├── DataError (also ValueError)
    ├── ParameterError (also ValueError)
    └── GenerationError (also RuntimeError)
```

SDK callers can catch [`UserError`][nemo_safe_synthesizer.errors.UserError] to handle all user-facing errors, or
[`SafeSynthesizerError`][nemo_safe_synthesizer.errors.SafeSynthesizerError] to also catch internal errors. Catching the built-in
base (`ValueError`, `RuntimeError`) also works since each class inherits from
both.

### DataError

Bad input data -- NaNs, unsupported types, empty DataFrames, missing values
in group or timestamp columns.

Checklist:

1. Verify your CSV loads cleanly with `pd.read_csv()`
2. Check for mixed types in columns
3. Check that column names in your config match the actual data
4. For time series, ensure no nulls in timestamp or group columns

Context-length errors (records too long for the model) raise `GenerationError`,
not `DataError` -- see [Context Length and Record Fitting](#context-length-and-record-fitting).

### ParameterError

Invalid configuration -- missing columns referenced in config, incompatible
option combinations, or missing required parameters. The stacktrace will indicate which parameter is invalid.

Checklist:

1. Run `safe-synthesizer config validate --config config.yaml`
2. Verify column names in `group_training_examples_by` and
   `order_training_examples_by` exist in your data
3. For DP, ensure all required privacy parameters are set

### GenerationError

Errors during generation or data assembly. Two common cases:

- Sampling failures (no valid records, patience exceeded) -- see [GenerationError](#generationerror) in the Generation section
- Context-length errors during data assembly (records too long for the model) -- see [Context Length and Record Fitting](#context-length-and-record-fitting)

### InternalError

Library bugs. If you encounter this error through documented interfaces,
please [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Safe-Synthesizer/issues).
