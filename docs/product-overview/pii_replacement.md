# PII Replacement

PII replacement v3 uses a dataset-specific replacement plan. The plan names
the columns NSS should replace, the entity type in each column, optional format
patterns, and dependencies between related columns.

This branch provides the configuration and plan-resolution contract, LLM plan
enhancement, and plan-only CLI and SDK workflows. Replacement execution remains
deferred. Until the executor is available, set `replace_pii: null`, pass
`--no-replace-pii`, or call `.with_replace_pii(enable=False)` to run the
synthesis pipeline.

## Replacement plan sources

`replace_pii.replacement_plan` accepts three forms.

The `replace_pii` configuration has an integer `schema_version`. This release
accepts version `3`; an omitted version is interpreted as version `3`. NSS
includes the version whenever it serializes the configuration.

### Automatic discovery

Use `auto_discovery` to run the heuristic plan discoverer. When `llm` is
configured, NSS passes the heuristic result to the LLM plan enhancer before
validating the final plan.

```yaml
replace_pii:
  schema_version: 3
  replacement_plan: auto_discovery
```

### Inline plan

An inline plan is written directly under `replacement_plan` in the main NSS
configuration:

```yaml
replace_pii:
  schema_version: 3
  replacement_plan:
    columns_to_replace:
      - column_name: full_name
        entity_type: full_name
        pattern: "{First} {Last}"
      - column_name: email
        entity_type: email
        pattern: "{f}.{last}@{domain}"
        depends_on:
          - column_name: full_name
```

### Plan file

A plan file is a separately versioned YAML document containing
`schema_version` followed by the same fields as an inline plan:

```yaml
schema_version: 3
columns_to_replace:
  - column_name: email
    entity_type: email
```

Set `replacement_plan` to its path:

```yaml
replace_pii:
  schema_version: 3
  replacement_plan: ./pii_replacement_plan.yaml
```

Inline plans and plan files are authoritative: NSS validates them against the
input dataframe but does not run heuristic or LLM discovery. This bypass applies
only to plan discovery. If `llm` is configured, the replacement executor can
still use it to replace PII found inside free-text columns named by the plan.

## Plan-only workflow

Resolve and save a plan from the full input dataframe without running holdout,
model metadata, replacement, training, generation, or evaluation:

```bash
safe-synthesizer run replace-pii --plan-only \
  --config config.yaml \
  --data-source data.csv
```

The command writes `pii_replacement_plan.yaml` in the standard timestamped NSS
run directory under `--artifact-path`.

The matching SDK interface returns the resolved plan and writes YAML only when
an output path is supplied:

```python
from nemo_safe_synthesizer.config import SafeSynthesizerParameters
from nemo_safe_synthesizer.sdk.library_builder import SafeSynthesizer

config = SafeSynthesizerParameters.from_yaml("config.yaml")
plan = (
    SafeSynthesizer(config)
    .with_data_source("data.csv")
    .plan_pii_replacement("pii_replacement_plan.yaml")
)
```

The generated standalone plan can be reviewed, edited, and reused as
`replace_pii.replacement_plan` in a later run.

## LLM-assisted planning and free-text replacement

The `llm` mapping configures the OpenAI-compatible inference service shared by
plan enhancement and free-text replacement. During automatic discovery, the LLM
enhances the heuristic plan. During execution, the same service processes
free-text columns in the resolved plan.

```yaml
replace_pii:
  schema_version: 3
  replacement_plan: auto_discovery
  llm:
    model_id: nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b
    max_workers: 8
```

An empty mapping (`llm: {}`) enables the existing NSS inference defaults. Set
the OpenAI-compatible endpoint at runtime through `NSS_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT` or
the `--inference-endpoint-url` CLI option. For example, a local vLLM server may
use `NSS_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000/v1` with its served model ID.

Endpoint and model settings resolve in this order: explicit CLI runtime flags,
the `replace_pii.llm` mapping, `NSS_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT` and
`NSS_INFERENCE_MODEL`, then the NSS defaults. The default hosted NVIDIA
endpoint requires an API key. Keyless operation is supported for local
OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

Supply the inference API key at runtime through `NSS_INFERENCE_KEY` or the
`--inference-api-key` CLI option. NSS does not store the key in configuration or
plan artifacts.

Automatic discovery uses two LLM passes. The first classifies every column's
semantic entity type and may propose a replacement pattern, in bounded batches
of at most 32 profiles and 48 KiB of profile evidence. Each profile contains
deterministic statistics and up to eight distinct cell samples truncated to 128
characters. The prompt includes the entity catalog and the exact supported
pattern grammars. NSS then derives replacement columns and all permitted
dependency candidates deterministically from those classifications. The second
pass can only select contextually useful dependency candidate IDs. Candidates
identify edges selected by the heuristic baseline so that choice remains
available as fallible prior evidence. NSS, rather than the model, supplies the
plan scope, excludes protected ordering and timestamp columns, and validates the
assembled plan. Grouping columns remain eligible for replacement so identifiers
such as patient IDs can be anonymized.

Each request permits up to three attempts for transient transport failures or
invalid structured responses. Authentication, authorization, and permanent
configuration failures stop immediately. If structured output remains invalid,
planning fails instead of falling back to the heuristic baseline. Invalid
optional patterns receive up to three focused repair attempts; NSS drops only
the pattern and warns if repair is exhausted.

LLM operations can send bounded raw cell samples during plan enhancement and raw
free-text values during replacement. Do not enable them unless the endpoint is
approved to receive the input data.
